# Mission-to-Mars
## Overview:
Robin wanted to put together a web app to display current/most recent information about Mars. In addition, she wanted to add images of the hemispheres. In order to complete this task we scraped the images of Mars's hemispheres as well as the titles fo those images. We then stored the data to MongoDB to display.
